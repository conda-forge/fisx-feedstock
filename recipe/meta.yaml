  summary: Quantitative X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis Support Library
  description: |
    This software library implements formulas to calculate, given an experimental setup, the expected x-ray fluorescence intensities.
    The library accounts for secondary and tertiary excitation, K, L and M shell emission lines and de-excitation cascade effects.
    The basic implementation is written in C++ and a Python binding is provided.
